## MediaWiki Extension Boilerplate Maker

A web interface to create boilerplate extension for MediaWiki development.

## Development
This is not quite ready for use yet; there are several issues that are still being worked on. The tool is fairly stable and produces a basic boilerplate extension, but may still be buggy and may miss a few elements while development is ongoing.

**Feel free to contribute!**

## Install
If you want to use this tool, make sure to:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run composer install
3. Make sure `/temp` and `/includes/twig/cace` are both writable by the web server.

## Contribute
This is fully open source tool. It will be hosted so anyone that wants to use it can do so without running the script.

Pull requests are welcome! Please participate and help make this a great tool!
